Thanks to Taylor the majority of use who handle API based authentication and authorisation now have it easy and 
through the sanctum package. However, the package only allows for the management of access tokens and the permissions 
on them which is why after implementing authentication endpoints based of off sanctum I have decided like any other dev
to create my own package that I aim to use throughout all my APIs. 

I am to start by supporting the latest version of Laravel and then creating other version to add support for more. I will
be following the PSR12 standard for those who wish to contribute and help maintain this package.
